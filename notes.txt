1.Create folder on desktop, open on vs code.

2.npm create vite@latest .(dot)	-- You are already inside a folder and want to scaffold the project there
  npm create vite@latest project_name -- You want to create a new project in a new folder

3.npm i -- for node_modules(all depensencies for projects). These are defined in the package.json
  "dependencies" – code needed at runtime
  "devDependencies" – code needed only during development.
  It’s excluded in .gitignore

Folder Structure For React Project --

a.📁 public/ -- Static files go here (e.g., images, icons, robots.txt)
  Jo files public/ folder mein hain, wo bina kisi badlaav ke (as-is) browser ko milti hain — aur directly root URL par milti hain.Iska matlab hai Vite koi processing ya bundling nahi karta un files ke saath.

b.📁 src/ -- Source code lives here (JavaScript/TypeScript, components, styles)
You’ll usually create subfolders here like components/, pages/, assets/, etc.
Default files:

main.ts / main.jsx – app entry point (where rendering starts), "main.js converts App.js into DOM structure"
That action is called “mounting to the DOM”.(mount - to organize something)

App.tsx / App.jsx – main component of the app. Core UI layout/component

c.Git --	A tool on your computer	Tracks changes to files (version control).Git is a piece of software.
  GitHub -- A website Stores your Git projects online so you can share and collaborate

📄gitignore -- Tells Git which files/folders to ignore or not include in version control(Version control is the software engineering practice of controlling, organizing, and tracking different versions in history of computer files; primarily source code text files). Usually includes: node_modules/, .env, dist/. These files will not be committed or pushed to GitHub or other repos.

d.ESLint --	Focuses on code quality and errors. eslint.config.js --It is a configuration file for ESLint.A configuration file is a file that tells a tool how to behave or what settings to use.

e.index.html -- The first HTML file the browser loads.
Vite’s role	-- Serves it and injects your app into it
<div id="root">	The placeholder where your app goes.

🔄 Step-by-Step: What Happens When You Open the App?
✅ Browser loads index.html
✅ It sees this line: <script type="module" src="/main.js"></script>
✅ Browser then loads and runs main.js
✅ main.js renders the React (or Vue) app inside <div id="root">

f.package-lock.json -- Locks the exact versions of every installed package.Makes sure everyone installs the exact same thing, even on different computers.
10.package.json --	Lists your app's dependencies and scripts(Scripts are shortcut commands we define to run common tasks — like starting your app, building it, or running tests).

g.📄 README.md -- Basic project instructions. Safe to edit or replace with your own project documentation

h.vite.config.js -- is like a settings file for Vite.

Which plugins to use (like React, Vue, etc.)
How to run the dev server (port, proxy, etc.)
Where the build files should go

It tells Vite:
"Hey, I'm using React"
"Start my app on port 3000"
"Put the final build files in the dist/ folder".

4. Then install tailwind vite, using 6 step process. It will add two extra file - postcss.config.js and tailwind.config.js.
Delete App.css from src, we don't need it, becoz we are using tailwind css. Delete static file inside public,
delete react.svg file from assets, delete all code of App.jsx and replace with rfc code.

5.Pushing code at github -- type three commands - 1. git init (enter) 2. git add . (enter) 3. git commit -m "about project". Then create repository on github.After that run there given commands of repository on terminal -1.  git remote add origin https://github.com/abhianand3672/Skill-Share.git (enter)
          2.  git branch -M main (enter)
          3.  git push -u origin main(enter)


CREATE PAGES AND ROUTE --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Inside src, create pages folder, inside it create .jsx pages, like - Sign.jsx, About.jsx, Home.jsx, etc.
2. For routing between pages, we will install npm i react-router-dom, inside client folder, then setup route of pages in App.jsx. 

CREATE HEADER COMPONENT --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Inside src folder create component, inside it create header.jsx. Install npm i react-icons for using icons in react project, then import {FaSearch} from 'react-icons/fa'; in HEADER.jsx.
